There are two folders here (John and Serak) where inside them are each trial which consists of a single step that was recorded.

There are also two files named John_All_In_One and Serak_All_In_One which is all the data contained for each person in one file, respectively, and formatted for the ML training model. 


"Im not entirely sure why I left the folders with the individual trials inside, but in case it may be useful for some reason I just thought why not leave them in here" - Serak.
