*****Notes*****

- 10 trials for each person in normal walking, 5 trials for each person during sitting/standing positions


Normal Walking notes and observations
- Each trial, we made 6 steps with our right foot

- First step begins with our right foot

- Normal walking has spikes for the pitch values (y-axis) that indicates each step taken by the right foot

- For now, just neglect the yaw values (z-axis) because it corresponds to the direction we are facing upon walking. 
  We are not sure if this is relevant for this trial, it is safe to just leave out for now.


Sitting/Standing
- graph is stagnant and steady

- might not be the most useful data, but can be used to compare when someone is sitting/standing or walking
